# Magnetize-Clone
Warning! my engrish can burns your eyes.

Introduction
  Welcome to my repository! This prototype from a game called Magnetize that i found from a certain website (https://www.kongregate.com/games/rocky10529/magnetized)
So, whats in this repository?
<b>Level Exporter(Basic)</b>
  just duplicate, drag and drop wall, any scene object and play the game to export your scene as a json(thanks Newtonsoft!).
  the level that has been exported will be loaded in lexicographic(alphabetical) order.
